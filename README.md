# TomatoLeafAI

**TomatoLeafAI** is a deep learning–based image classification model designed to detect common diseases in tomato plant leaves with high accuracy. Leveraging a custom-built **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture**, this model delivers high-accuracy disease diagnosis directly from tomato leaf images, making it ideal for practical, real-world agricultural applications. It is designed for both educational clarity and future-ready integration with cloud and mobile platforms.

This project is a key module within **Project Kisan** : An AI-driven initiative focused on empowering small and marginal farmers with accessible, technology-based agricultural solutions. TomatoLeafAI aims to assist farmers in identifying crop health issues early, reducing crop losses, and improving yield through timely interventions and expert recommendations.

## 📊 Disease Detection Workflow

![TomatoLeafAI Workflow](images/tomatoleafai_workflow.jpg)

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Capture or upload an image of a tomato leaf.
2. The model analyzes the image and classifies it as:
   - Early Blight
   - Late Blight
   - Healthy
3. Future updates will include voice-based feedback and Firebase integration.

## 🧪 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TomatoLeafAI.git
cd TomatoLeafAI
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare Dataset

Place the following folders inside a raw_tomato_dataset/ directory:

```text
raw_tomato_dataset/
├── Tomato___Early_blight/
├── Tomato___Late_blight/
└── Tomato___healthy/
```

Then run the dataset splitter to create training and validation sets:

```bash
python split_dataset.py
```

### 4. Train the Model

```bash
python plant_disease_model.py
```

The trained model will be saved as:
plant_disease_model.h5

### 5. Test the Model

Place a test image (e.g., leaf.jpg) in the project directory. Update the filename inside test_prediction.py and run:

```bash
python test_prediction.py
```

### 6. Convert to TensorFlow Lite (Optional)

For mobile or Firebase deployment.
